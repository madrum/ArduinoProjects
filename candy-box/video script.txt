Do you ever get a late night craving...
and see your kid's candy and think, "They won't miss one or two!"

but what if, your kid was a builder!?!? and locked you out of their candy supply!?!?

I teamed up with my two boys to build a candy safe
to protect their most delicious posssesions
... and keep me out

we have a self-contained box, LCD display, arduino, and servo, with an infrared receiver paired with a remote,
that will only grant access to those with a secret code.

In the end, I was able to convince my boys to give me a whole 2 seoncds to access the candy, 
which is better than nothing!

I want to thank Mark Rober for putting so much time and effort into this course, making this the best quarantine ever!

I also want to thank my awesome peer group. I learned so much from you all and was totally blown away by your creativity and engenuity

I also want to thank my amazing wife and boys for joining me in this amazing experience.

thank you all.
